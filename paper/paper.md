# Summary

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [@LISA:2018] is an upcoming space-based mission designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) of both astrophysical and cosmological origin in the milli-hertz band. LISA is expected to observe thousands of white dwarf binaries within the Milky Way simultaneously, while an unresolved population of such binaries will overlap incoherently, forming the so-called galactic foreground.
One of the central challenges of the so-called *global fit* [@Katz:2025] is to jointly model both the resolvable and unresolvable white dwarf populations. 
In this article, we present `bahamas`, a Python package for Bayesian inference of the galactic foreground and stochastic background towards a global fit perspective. it leverages Hamiltonian Markov Chain Montecarlo (HMCMC) @
